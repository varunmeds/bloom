# Bloom

*A coffee estate simulation set in the misty hills of Coorg, India.*

> In the Western Ghats, where mist clings to the hills and coffee blossoms paint the slopes white, you inherit an estate. Bloom is a meditation on seasons, soil, and the slow magic of cultivation.

Grow, harvest, and process coffee through the seasons — from seedling to cup.
